## A simple web chat app

### Theme
* When the app is done, the theme will likely be a dark, computery theme.  Like a terminal.
* The theme will be incorporated with dark css styling and simple, minimal layout

### Issues
* Auth is not up yet
* SQL/ storing messages is not up yet
* keeping track of users is not done yet + threads view
* The chat app window does not seem to fill the screen 100% correctly

### Planned improvements
* Adding a chatbot
* Emojis and URL support
